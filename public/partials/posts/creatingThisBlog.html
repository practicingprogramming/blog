<p>
  The first post is, naturally, about  creating this website.
</p>
<p>
  There are a lot of blogging platforms out there, but writing things by myself is the very purpose of this blog.
  So, I decided to make my own blogging platform from scratch.
  It doesn't have to be a real platform though: it should just work for this particular website.
</p>

<p>
  These are the minimal requirements:
  <ul>
    <li>Must be able to host static articles.</li>
    <li>Must be able to show those static articles in a feed.</li>
    <li>Must have "About" page.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Desired but not necessary for launch:
  <ul>
    <li>Ability to leave comments.</li>
    <li>Convenient publishing of new material.</li>
    <li>Analytics.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  To satisfy the minimal requirements itâ€™s enough for it to be completely static (HTML + JS + CSS, no backend).
  All I need to do is to write a bunch of HTML and host it somewhere.
  I chose to host in on AWS S3 as it looks like a good option, plus I'm quite familiar with it.
</p>

<p>
  Technologies I chose to use:
  <ul>
    <li>AWS S3 + Route53 for hosting.</li>
    <li>node + expressjs for running it locally.</li>
    <li>Grunt for building.</li>
    <li>Bootstrap for styling.</li>
    <li>Angular.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Overall, it was pretty straightforward.
  Hosting a website on S3 is described in much details <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/swh/website-hosting-intro.html">here</a>.
  The only thing that required some coding effort was displaying all posts at once on the front page.
  But that wasn't difficult either.
</p>

<p>
  Things I've learned:
  <ul>
    <li>How to host a website on S3.</li>
    <li>How to register a domain and point it at the website with Route53.</li>
    <li>
      How to setup Angular and Grunt.
      I've participated in projects using them, but had never done the initial setup myself before.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  What I should do in the future:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Add unit tests.
      Usually I'm all for test-driven development.
      But in this case I have probably 10 lines of code, so I decided it was not even worth bothering.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add some sort of analytics.
      Perhaps I should use one of the services analyzing S3 access logs.
      It's a little strange that S3 itself does not provide this functionality.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enable SSL.
      Not a big deal at the moment because it's static, so there are no interactions to secure.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use CloudFront for distribution.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Conclusions:
  <ul>
    <li>AWS is a great option for hosting static websites.</li>
  </ul>
